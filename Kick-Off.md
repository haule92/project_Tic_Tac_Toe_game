## Project Description
In this project, you will create your first software!
You are tasked with creating a **game** that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources you have learned during the week. Your game will be able to take an input from the user and provide an output. 

You will also present your game to the class. 

You can find some game ideas below.

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/pc2CNZTo/project-1-build-your-own-game).
* You **CAN'T CODE** until you project is planned. 
* Create a *.gitignore* file and include it in your repository. 
* Use functions.

## Deliverables
You must turn in the git repo you used while building your project. Remember to commit often to avoid trouble in case you mess up (this means more than 1 commit!).

## Mentoring
One of the TAs will be your mentor!
Your mentor will:
* Follow your project in general, will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following the tasks, your blockers, etc
* Help/support you in specific questions.

Your mentor is not meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your manager. You have to be the responsible person to do the tasks!
